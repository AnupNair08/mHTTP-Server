Apache2 logger file is found in /var/logs/apache2

Two types of logs:
1. Access logs => Keeps track of all the access requests made to the web server and the servers response to those requests

2. Error logs => Keeps a track of the errors encountered during any request response cycle and in general keeps track of the state of the server

Common format of a log file:
1. %>s HTTP status code for a request
2. %U URL of the specified resource
3. %a IP address of the client
4. %T Time required to make the request
5. %t Timestamp either in RFC 1123/1036/ANSI C time format

Decide on a specified format that is read from the config file of the server.
Essentially keep two levels of logging => One for the access and the other for the errors like apache2

[ Ability to define custom logging format via the config file ]
